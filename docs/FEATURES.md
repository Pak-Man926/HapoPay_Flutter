# Features & Screens

HapoPay provides a tailored experience for both parents and students.

## 1. Authentication

All credential validations and registrations are completed using Django REST token paths.

- **Login Screen** — Inputs for email and password. Coordinates JWT exchanges with Django, caches tokens securely in device hardware, and syncs sessions to the local Supabase client.
- **Biometric Integration** — Option to cache credentials locally and authorize sessions using iOS FaceID or Android Fingerprint verification via `local_auth`.

## 2. Parent Dashboard

Provides primary oversight controls for the family ledger.

- **Limit Adjustments** — Slider and form inputs allowing immediate edits to a student's daily or weekly spending limits via PATCH requests to `/api/children/{id}/`.
- **Card Lock Switch** — Quick toggling mechanism that sets a student's limit to `$0`, suspending payment capability instantly.
- **Real-Time Transaction Feed** — Interactive transaction list displaying incoming payments from students, backed by Supabase postgres streams.

## 3. Student Dashboard

Features centered around payment executions and saving achievements.

- **QR Payment Creator** — Generates signed, dynamic QR payment markers containing expiring authorization credentials.
- **QR Payment Scanner** — Camera viewport powered by `mobile_scanner` that enables payment processing at merchant portals.
- **Gamified Rewards Tracker** — Visual progress tracking for milestone achievements, linking to the `/api/rewards/` Django route.

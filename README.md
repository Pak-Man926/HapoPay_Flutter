## 1. Project Overview

HapoPay is a parent-student money management and smart spending platform. The mobile application, built with Flutter, provides parents with the tools to manage their children's allowances, adjust transaction limits, and monitor spending in real time. For students, it provides a safe payment interface using dynamic QR codes, biometric authorization, and a gamified financial education hub. 

The application utilizes a hybrid backend model: Django serves as the primary business logic and transaction gateway, while Supabase provides real-time transaction updates, persistent database hosting, and storage.

## 8. Configuration & Environment Variables

### 8.1 Environment Files

The application requires environment properties to be injected during the build phase. Create a `.env.dev` or `.env.prod` file from the repository's sample configuration.

```bash
# .env.example -> Copy values to target environment profiles
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-instance.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-public-anon-key
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

### 8.2 Safe Environment Injection

Pass variables directly to compile commands to prevent hardcoding configuration strings into project scripts:

```bash
# Inject local development configs
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env.dev
```

---

## 9. Build & Deployment

### 9.1 Android Signing

Set up the key details locally in `android/key.properties`. Ensure this file is never tracked in source control.

```properties
storePassword=your-android-keystore-password
keyPassword=your-android-key-password
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=../keys/upload-keystore.jks
```

Build commands:

```bash
# Build production bundle (recommended for Google Play Console)
flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define-from-file=.env.prod

# Build stand-alone APK
flutter build apk --release --dart-define-from-file=.env.prod
```

### 9.2 iOS Deployment

iOS distribution builds require provisioning profiles and code-signing assets within Xcode.

```bash
# Compile distribution archive
flutter build ipa --release --dart-define-from-file=.env.prod
```

## 10. Troubleshooting & FAQs

| Error / Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| `Connection refused` on Android Emulator | `localhost` points to emulator loopback, not the host machine | Modify `API_BASE_URL` in `.env.dev` to target `10.0.2.2` (Android host routing IP) instead of `localhost` / `127.0.0.1`. |
| Realtime subscription fails | Replication configuration not toggled on targets | Ensure tables in Supabase Console are active under **Database > Replication**. |
| Invalid JWT token | Supabase and Django token alignment issue | Verify that the signing keys of the Django SimpleJWT configuration and Supabase match if sharing tokens directly. |
| Keystore compilation failure | Missing `key.properties` configuration | Ensure `key.properties` exists in the `android/` directory and points to a valid `.jks` file. |
| Camera viewport blank | Permissions configurations omitted | Check iOS `Info.plist` and Android `AndroidManifest.xml` for `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `CAMERA` permissions. |
